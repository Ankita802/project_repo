The purpose of this report is to inform the Agencies about the impact of their participation in improving the User Experience (UX) of Broker.\\n\\n1. Background:\\nBroker is a platform designed to facilitate seamless communication and collaboration between Agencies and UI designers. To ensure a user-centric design, user testing was conducted to gather feedback and insights from the Agencies who actively use the platform.\\n\\n2. Methodology:\\nThe user testing process involved a diverse group of Agencies who were given specific tasks to perform on the Broker platform. Their interactions and feedback were observed and recorded to identify pain points, usability issues, and areas for improvement.\\n\\n3. Key Findings:\\na. Navigation and Information Architecture:\\n   - Agencies expressed difficulty in finding specific features or sections within the platform.\\n   - Confusion was observed regarding the organization of information and the hierarchy of menu options.\\n\\nb. User Interface and Visual Design:\\n   - Some Agencies found the color scheme and contrast challenging, affecting readability.\\n   - Feedback indicated a desire for a more intuitive and visually appealing interface.\\n\\nc. Functionality and Interaction:\\n   - Certain features were not easily discoverable, leading to frustration and inefficiency.\\n   - Agencies requested more streamlined workflows and simplified interactions.\\n\\n4. Contributions to UX Improvement:\\na.

Disable the submit button after the first submission: Once the user submits the form, disable the submit button to prevent further submissions. This can be achieved by adding a CSS class or setting the button's `disabled` attribute to `true`.\\n\\n2. Use a server-side check: When a submission is received, store a unique identifier (e.g., a session ID or a timestamp) associated with that submission on the server. On subsequent submissions, check if the identifier already exists. If it does, reject the submission as a duplicate.\\n\\n3. Implement a client-side check: Store a unique identifier in the user's browser (e.g., using cookies or local storage) when a submission is made. Before allowing a new submission, check if the identifier already exists. If it does, prevent the submission from being sent.\\n\\n4. Implement a confirmation page: After the user submits the form, redirect them to a confirmation page. This way, refreshing the page won't trigger a duplicate submission. The confirmation page can display a success message and provide additional information or actions.\\n\\n5. Use a form token: Generate a unique token for each form submission and include it as a hidden field in the form. When a submission is received, check if the token has already been used.

       " Document(page_content='\\ufeffinput: As a broker team member, I want to make some updates to the SQL codes for clarity.\\nresult: Here are some suggestions to improve the clarity of your SQL codes as a broker team member:\\n\\n1. Use meaningful table and column aliases: Instead of using generic aliases like \"t1\" or \"c1\", provide more descriptive aliases that reflect the purpose of the table or column. For example, instead of \"SELECT t1.name FROM customers AS t1\", use \"SELECT customer.name FROM customers AS customer\".\\n\\n2. Indentation and formatting: Proper indentation and formatting can greatly enhance the readability of your SQL codes. Use consistent spacing and line breaks to separate different clauses and make the code easier to follow. For example:\\n\\n   SELECT\\n       customer.name,\\n       customer.email\\n   FROM\\n       customers AS customer\\n   WHERE\\n       customer.age > 18\\n\\n3. Comment your code: Add comments to explain the purpose or logic behind complex queries or specific sections of your code. This can help other team members understand your code and make future updates or modifications easier. For example:\\n\\n   -- Retrieve the names and emails of customers above 18 years old\\n   SELECT\\n       customer.name,\\n       customer.email\\n   FROM\\n       customers AS customer\\n   WHERE\\n       customer.age > 18\\n\\n4. Use explicit JOIN syntax: Instead of using implicit joins, use explicit JOIN syntax to make the relationships between tables more apparent. This can improve the clarity of your code and make it easier to understand the logic behind the query. For example:\\n\\n   SELECT\\n       customer.name,\\n       orders.order_date\\n   FROM\\n       customers AS customer\\n   JOIN\\n       orders ON customer.id = orders.customer_id\\n\\n5. Break down complex queries into smaller, manageable parts: If you have a complex query, consider breaking it down into smaller subqueries or using temporary tables to simplify the code and improve readability. This can also make it easier to debug and maintain the code in the future.\\n\\nBy implementing these suggestions, you can enhance the clarity and readability of your SQL codes as a broker team member.\\n: ', metadata={'source': 'Data_built.csv', 'row': 44}),\n",

Identify the specific geospatial attributes that are relevant to your work and require your attention. These attributes could include location coordinates, boundaries, land use classifications, or any other spatial data that may affect the permit/application review process.\\n\\n2. Determine the source or database where these geospatial attributes are stored. It could be a GIS (Geographic Information System) database, a web mapping service, or any other platform that manages and updates spatial data.\\n\\n3. Check if the data source or database provides a notification system or an API (Application Programming Interface) that allows you to subscribe to updates. Many GIS platforms offer such functionality, enabling you to receive notifications when changes occur in the specified geospatial attributes.\\n\\n4. If the data source does not have a built-in notification system, you can explore alternative options. One approach is to use a data monitoring tool or service that can track changes in the geospatial attributes you are interested in.

This will allow me to quickly find the specific type of files I am looking for and avoid unnecessary clutter.\\n\\nAcceptance Criteria:\\n1. The search results page should have a filter option for file types.\\n2. The available file types for filtering should include common file formats such as documents (e.g., PDF, DOCX), images (e.g., JPG, PNG), videos (e.g., MP4, AVI), and audio files (e.g., MP3, WAV).\\n3. The filter option should be easily accessible and intuitive to use.\\n4. When a user selects a specific file type filter, the search results should update to only display files of that type.\\n5. The filter option should allow for multiple file types to be selected simultaneously, enabling the user to view files of different types at once.\\n6. The filter option should have a \"Clear\" or \"Reset\" button to remove any applied filters and display all file types again.\\n7. The filter option should be responsive and work effectively on different devices and screen sizes.\\n\\nAdditional Considerations:\\n- The file type filter could include an \"All\" option to display all file types without any filtering.\\n- The filter option could provide a count or indication of the number of files available for each file type to help users make informed decisions.\\n- The filter option could have a search bar to allow users to search for specific file types instead of scrolling through a long list.\\n- The filter option could remember the user\\'s selected file types and apply them automatically for future searches until changed or cleared.\\n: ', metadata={'source': 'Data_built.csv', 'row': 825}),\n",
